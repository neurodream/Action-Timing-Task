# BFTUSk
action timing task for the BFTUS study

## how to use analysis code
- open command line in directory; `pip install -e .`
- open and run the files in `scripts/`

## good practice for working on task
- try to implement in visual builder; use `BFTUS_task.psyexp`
- use separate code components for separate functions; name them intelligibly
- name variables as adjectives; functions as verbs
